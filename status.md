## Overall

**GANTT chart** 

## 

## Tasks for Feburary 07

Done

- Identify and reproduce some baseline models on datasets
- Define & Explore some hypotheses for better models
- Run a custom model on STM32 microcontrolle

## Run custom model on microcontroller

**YouTube video**

Findings

- STM32 NN implementation is propriatary
- Provided pre-processing code is hardcoded to 30 mels and 1024 bin FFT
- Provided pre-processing only supports non-overlapping analysis windows
- Significant amount of time spent on pre-processing. About half for ASC example

## Baseline models
