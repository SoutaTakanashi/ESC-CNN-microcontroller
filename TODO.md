## TODO

## Milestone 1: Ready for experimentation


Test & choose datasets

- Download the datasets, explore the data
- Make a trivial model, run against each
- Decide evaluation metrics

Test CNN model on microcontroller

- Test a trivial audio custom model with SMT32CubeAI
- Trigger LED change to reflect model predictions
- Check how the neural networks are implemented
- Test measuring current

Methodology proposal

- Write it
- Ask Oliver/Kristian for feedback

## Done

- Test standard models examples on STM32 devkits.
AudioLoop has USB Audio out, useful for recording test data.
ST BlueSensor Android app useful for testing.
Built-in example also had BT audio out (but locked at 8kHz?)
- Move project to dedicated git repo
- Setup skeleton of report Latex/Markdown
- Setup Travis CI
- Installed STM32Cube AI toolchain, and build STM32 AI examples (HAR)
- Make a shortlist of datasets to consider
- Order STM32 devkits
