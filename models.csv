Find out effect of better convolutional blocks on accuracy vs inference time.
(and striding)
(wide versus deep)
(different voting overlaps)

Stride in Keras/Tensorflow must be uniform.

first all with 5x5 kernel, 2 intermediate blocks.
Then can try 3x3 kernel, 3 intermediate blocks

Use same learning rate for all.

Adjust number of convolutions to make MACC approximately equal within groups.
Ref Google paper keyword spotting. tstride/fstride?

Should have a preflight check. Runs all models, in parallell, 1 epoch, 1 fold, 1/10 the samples.

Then can test reporting tools based on that.

Plot training curves together.
