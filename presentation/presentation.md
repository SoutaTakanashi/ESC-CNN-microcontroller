# Introduction


# Background

## Motivation


## Challenges

- RAM,FLASH,CPU constraints
- Training and inference are independent implementations. Have to be in sync

## Existing work


## Audio Classifications with CNNs

- Melspectrogram
- Analysis window

# Experimental

## Setup

- Urbansound8k

## Models

## Results



# Next steps

Soundsensing.
Forskningsraadet. Pilot Oslo Kommune
StartupLab incubator

Paper


# Questions

TODO: add project image again

# BONUS

## Unknown class

Improves precision at expense of recall

## What could be done better

- Hyperparameter tuning per method

## Working method

- Independent study Audio Classification. DAT390
- DCASE2018 conference
- Literature review. Summarized in report
- Experiments phase. Tried large amount of different classifiers
